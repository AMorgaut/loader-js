Locators
========

_Locators_ are JSON objects pointing to targets (packages or resources).

They are used whenever a target needs to be identified such as for the `mappings` or `dependencies`
properties in `package.json` files.


Properties

Indicate that a target is a plain resource and not a CommonJS package.
