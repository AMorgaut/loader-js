Program Wrappers
================

The following configuration is supported:

    {
        "implements": {
            "github.com/pinf/loader-js/-meta/strawman/program/wrapper/0.1": {
                "locator": <Locator>
            }
        }
    }
    
Where:

  * `<Locator>` is a locator object pointing to the program that will be spliced into:
    
        commonjs <WrapperProgram> <Program>
    
    when running:
    
        commonjs <Program>

Implemented:

  * `github.com/pinf/loader-js` does not support this yet.
  * `github.com/pinf/node-js` implements `locator.archive` if program.json is fetched from a local path.
